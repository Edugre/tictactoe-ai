# üïπÔ∏è Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Introduction
This project implements an AI player for Tic-Tac-Toe using **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**. The code also includes **state symmetry normalization** (hashing equivalent boards) to avoid re-computing identical positions under rotation/flip. We compare correctness and efficiency between plain Minimax and Alpha-Beta. 

To run the program:
`python main.py`
Using Python 3.x.

## Task 
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game on a 3√ó3 board.
- Players X and O take turns marking empty cells.
- The first player to align three symbols in a row wins.
- If the board fills with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

### Board Representation:
- X ‚Üí Player 1
- O ‚Üí Player 2
- _ ‚Üí Empty cell
 
## Algorithms

### Minimax

The Minimax algorithm simulates all possible moves, alternating between maximizing and minimizing turns. It anticipates the opponent‚Äôs responses and selects the optimal sequence of moves.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

Alpha-Beta Pruning optimizes Minimax by pruning branches that cannot affect the final outcome. Both algorithms use caching and state normalization to avoid recomputing equivalent board states.

## Symmetry Hashing

The `normalize()` function generates all rotations and reflections of the board and selects the canonical tuple representation. This ensures symmetric states are evaluated only once, improving efficiency.

## Game Rules & Evaluation
-	`utility()` ‚Äì checks all rows, columns, and diagonals for a win.
-	`is_terminal()` ‚Äì detects if the game has reached a win or draw.
-	`evaluate()` ‚Äì returns:
    -	+10 if X wins
    -	‚àí10 if O wins
    -	0 if it‚Äôs a draw
-	`actions()` ‚Äì lists available empty cells.
-	`result()` / undo_move() ‚Äì simulate and revert moves during AI decision-making.

## Performance, Discussion & Future Work

The Tic-Tac-Toe branching factor reaches up to nine moves at the start, leading to exponential growth in the Minimax search tree. Alpha-Beta Pruning produces the same optimal results but explores fewer nodes, reducing computation time.

Caching and symmetry reduction further improve efficiency without affecting correctness.

Both Minimax and Alpha-Beta guarantee **optimal play**, but Alpha-Beta achieves it with **significantly reduced computation time**.
